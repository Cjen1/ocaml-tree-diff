# A diffing library, name to be confirmed

Library to diff arbitrary tree-like data structures using the Zhang Shasha Algorithm (Simple fast algorithms for the edit distance between trees and related problems).

##TODO
- Update with an approximate algorithm such as (1+Îµ approximation of tree edit distance in quadratic time).
- Implement a pretty printer for the diffed output (perhaps similar to patch updates?)
- Refactor to provide a functor
